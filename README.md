# chat-with-website
In this project I will be building a website-interacting chatbot using Python, Langchain, and Streamlit. Integrate Langchain with LLMs for dynamic website interaction, creating a user-friendly GUI. The process includes implementing RAG algorithms and a vector store for efficient information retrieval.
